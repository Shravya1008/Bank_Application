Here's a detailed `README.md` file for your banking application project based on the `app.py` and `Dockerfile` you shared:

# 🏦 Banking Application (Flask + SQLite)

A simple web-based banking application developed using Flask and SQLite that allows users to manage bank accounts with features like creating an account, checking balance, depositing and withdrawing funds.

---

## 🧭 Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a basic CRUD-based banking system using Flask as the backend framework and SQLite for data storage. The application provides a minimal user interface through HTML templates rendered within Flask, and is containerized using Docker for portability.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stacks

* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **Database**: SQLite
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Frontend**: HTML (rendered via `render_template_string` in Flask)

---

## 🪜 Steps Included

1. **Database Initialization**

   * Creates a SQLite database `bank.db` and sets up a table `accounts` with fields: `id`, `name`, and `balance`.

2. **Endpoints**

   * `/` – Home page
   * `/create` – Create a new bank account
   * `/balance` – Check the balance for a given account
   * `/deposit` – Deposit amount into an account
   * `/withdraw` – Withdraw amount from an account
   * `/statement` – Placeholder for transaction statement (to be implemented)

3. **Web UI**

   * Minimalist UI built with inline HTML/CSS.
   * Uses a consistent layout with a navigation bar and styled sections.

4. **Docker Support**

   * Includes a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app for easy deployment.
   * Exposes port `5005` for browser access.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* **Data Persistence**: The use of SQLite allows easy local development and quick testing without setting up a full-fledged DBMS.
* **Web Simplicity**: Demonstrates building full functionality with a single file `app.py`, using `render_template_string` instead of external HTML files.
* **Scalability Consideration**: Though currently limited to one-table operations, the structure allows for easy expansion into multi-table design with transaction logging.
* **Security Consideration**: This basic version lacks authentication and input validation. It should not be used as-is for production.
